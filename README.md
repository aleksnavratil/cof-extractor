# cof-extractor
A short Python program that consumes the name of a directory containing some tribometer datafiles, and produces as output a neatly-formatted list of the average friction coefficients of each .csv

## How to run:

On Unix, just do this:
```
python cof_extractor
```

On Windows, you can probably run it in your IDE or from the Windows command prompt.
Either way, make sure you have the dependencies, such as NumPy, satisfied.
